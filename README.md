# base16-chrome

This repository is meant to (eventually) work with
[chriskempson/base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).
It provides a simple template that can be used with the base16 color schemes to
generate a theme for the Google Chrome browser.

Note that it currently requires a forked version of base16 that adds [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV) support. One example is located in a branch at https://github.com/guill/base16-universal-manager/tree/make_installable
